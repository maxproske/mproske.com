                <p class="description">I wanted to host an event that would showcase a distinguished software engineer's beginnings in Computing Science. With the research assistance of my colleagues in the Computer Science Student Society, I was able to arrange a keynote talk with a member of the Mozilla Firefox development team.</p>
                <p class="description">Dethe Elza spoke about his origins in software engineering, as well as his involvement in the development of a security add-on for Firefox called Lightbeam.</p>
                <p class="description">The turnout was fantastic, perhaps due in part to free pizza and pop.</p>
