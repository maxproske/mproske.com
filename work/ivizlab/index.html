                <p class="description">As part of a directed study with <a href="https://www.dipaola.org/" target="_blank">Steve DiPaola</a>, past Director of Cognitive Science at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>, I proposed a solution that would improve scheduling, replace a very long e-mail chain, and eliminate the need to remote-in with TeamViewer. I designed a PHP web application, that could send any image processing requests to iVizLab's rendering workstation.</p>

                <p class="description">Users could upload any source image, select their desired parameters, and browse a gallery of existing recipes. By allowing users to select what output image they liked, ask what recipe was used to make it, and understand what parameters could be tweaked, researchers could more easily understand the landscape in which they are involved.</p>
