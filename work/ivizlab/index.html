            <p class="description">Working closely with the SFU Director of Cognitive Science and his team of PhDs, to improve the emotional and expressive realism of a painterly rendering system. Understanding deep learning, advanced image processing, and retraining neural networks for style recognition, while accommodating for backwards compatibility.</p>

                <p class="description">Languages: PHP, MySQL, Python.</p>

                <p class="description">I initially pitched the idea of a web-based resource management solution, because there was no scheduling and all development was to be done through an e-mail chain and TeamViewer, a free personal remote access software.</p>
                <p class="description">Batch Management System would act as an interface to allow users to use Deep Dream AI, without needing to receive training on the Linux operating system. In addition, I felt requiring a user to peer into the skeleton of lower-level deep dream code was like looking into an open wound. Even though our users would be mainly PhD students, there was a chance someone could accidently add a semicolon, and no-one will be able to use anything again. This was a potential concern I considered while brainstorming for this project.</p>

                <p class="description">One of the concepts iVizLab was actively trying to accomplish through analysis scripting, was helping users understand the landscape in which we are involved. I wanted to facilitate this, by allowing users to choose an image they liked, ask what recipe was used to make it, and understand what parameters could be changed. I felt the best way to do this was through a user-friendly web interface, that could pass on the user’s custom recipe to be scheduled on a computer through my college’s scheduler project.</p>
                <p class="description">I created a PHP web application over the course of four weeks, that could upload a source image, and prompt the user to select a model, layer, iteration, octave, and other options. In addition, the user could also select from a gallery of existing recipes.</p>
