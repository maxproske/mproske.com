            <p class="description">I improved the emotional and expressive realism of a painterly rendering system, during a directed study with Steve DiPaola, the SFU Director of Cognitive Science.</p>
                
            <p class="description">I designed a web interface and back-end which saved a gallery of deep learning model recipes. This would allow researchers to use the painterly rendering system, and tweak its parameters for emotional realism, without needing to receive training on the Linux operating system.</p>

                <p class="description">I created a PHP web application over the course of four weeks, that could upload a source image, and prompt the user to select a model, layer, iteration, octave, and other options. In addition, the user could also select from a gallery of existing recipes.</p>
                <p class="description">In addition, there was no automated scheduling, and all development was to be done through an e-mail chain and TeamViewer, a free personal remote access software. I felt the best way to do this was through a user-friendly web interface, that could pass on the user’s custom recipe to be scheduled on a computer through my college’s scheduler project.</p>

                <p class="description">By allowing users to choose an image they liked, ask what recipe was used to make it, and understand what parameters could be changed, users could more easily understand the landscape in which they are involved.</p>
