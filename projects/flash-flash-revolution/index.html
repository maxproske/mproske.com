            <p class="description"><a href="http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/FFR_the_Game.php" target="_blank">Flash Flash Revolution</a> is an online rhythm game created in 2002 by James Webb. The name is a tribute to Dance Dance Revolution, but is played using your keyboard.
            <p class="description">In 2014, I took over leadership of the site, and responsibility for engine development (ActionScript 3) and server-side programming (PHP, MySQL). I aim to represent the interests of the community, and collaborate with my team to implement solutions which improve overall player experience. My goal is to make rhythm games as accessible as possible.</p>
            <p class="description">Today, the site has 2 million registered users, and still maintains over 1,000 daily players, and 15,000 active monthly players.</p>

                <p class="description">Up until 2017, FFR could only be played through Adobe Flash Player and an Internet browser. With poor performance on modern operating systems, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adobe-systems-flash-idUSKBN1AA22R" target="_blank">the end of Flash in 2020</a>, we needed a solution.</p>
                <p class="description">I helped target a build for Adobe AIR, and add cool features along the way, including a desktop application, hardware acceleration, vsync, and an automated patcher.</p>
                <p class="description">R^3 Air Edition was the same great game engine, built entirely without Flash. By compiling from the same codebase, all future updates could target both browser and desktop editions.</p>
