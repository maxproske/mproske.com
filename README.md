# Portfolio

## Goals
A typical personal "brand" for a programmer should consist of (in descending order of importance):
- A professional resume
- An updated, active LinkedIn account
- An active GitHub account, with good code and contributions to other repos
- A personal blog (host it on GitHub pages with Jekyll for free)
